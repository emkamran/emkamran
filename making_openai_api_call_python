# How to make open ai api call using python

import openai
import os

openai.api_key = "INSERT-OPENAI-KEY-HERE"

def call_openai():
    prompt = """ Write your openai prompt here,
    you can use multiple lines.
        """

    completion = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=1950,
        n=1,
        temperature=0.4,
    )
    response = completion.choices[0].text
    return response
    
# # NOTES ##
# engine = the type of openai model, choose based on accuracy and costs, look at official openai engines list.
# max_tokens = maximum tokens include all characters in the prompt + response combined. 
# Different engines have different token limits, choose max to limit costs as well.
# n = 1, represents the number of iterations
# temperature represents the creativity level, keep it lower for more accuracy, higher if you want ai to be more creative with response.
# # End NOTES ##
